        <h1>Story</h1>

        <p>The dark green rowing shell cut through through the water like a hot knife through butter.</p>

        <p>The thin vessel surged forward with each stroke from the eight rowers inside moving in sync.</p>

        <p>This boat of racers, like all the others, gave it all they had to win here at the finals of the midwest championship.</p>

        <p> Each boat had to win a number of races earlier just to get here; now everything that they trained for all</p>

        <p>came down to one final race determining the placement of each crew. After an excruciating eight minutes of racing,</p>

        <p>each and every person giving his utmost to move the shell with the greatest speed in the most efficient way,</p>

        <p>our shell finally reached the finish. That boat took second place of all the boats in the Midwest region.</p>

        <p>I raced in the bow seat in that shell.  This was one of the times I was most conflicted in my entire life,</p>

        <p>we had placed second which was great, but we were less than a second off of taking first.</p>
